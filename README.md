# COMP-5002-CW2

## Introduction
A security Operations Centre (SOC) is the central area in an organisation which is responsible for monitoring, detecting and responding to cyber threats. The main purpose of is to maintain continuous visibility over security events, identify malicious activity and coordinate an effective response to protect the organisations infrastructure [1]. This report will show my investigation into the Boss of the SOCv3(BOTSv3) dataset for a fictitious brewing company called Frothly. This dataset is a Splunk based capture the flag(CTF). Its aim is to simulate a realistic cyber incident which contains collection of logs including: 
to cyber threats for the organisation [1]. This report will show my investigation into into the Boss of the SOCv3(BOTSv3) dataset. This dataset is a Splunk based capture the flag(CTF). Its aim is to simulate a realistic cyber incident which contains collection of logs including 

* network
* endpoint
* email
* cloud data from services like Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure

By analysing the dataset using Splunk it becomes possible to reconstruct/analyse the attacks behaviour, identify the indications of system compromise and be able to answer guided questions using Splunk. 

This report will be split into 4 sections. SOC roles and incident handling. Which will reflect on how SOC tiers, responsibilities and incident handling methodologies relate to the BOTSv3 exercise. As well as discussing prevention, detection, response and recovery phases. The next section will be installation and data preparation. This is where I will document the installation of Splunk, setting up the dataset. The third section is the guided questions. This is where I will answer the BOTSv3 300 level questions using Splunk queries and analysis. Finaly I will summarise my findings, key lessons and SOC strategy implications as well as highlighting improvements for detection and response.
